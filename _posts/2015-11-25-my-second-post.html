  <p>I discovered Marc Goone about twenty minutes before a plane ride to Portugal, and his shit was on repeat the entire flight. I'll throw out a disclaimer real quick: this usually isn't sunchine-and-care-bears rap. If weird stories, self-loathing, and cynicism doesn't do it for you, it might not be your cup of tea.</p>
  <br>
  <p>That said, he's one of the most honest, humble, and lyrically creative artists I've ever heard, if a bit troubled. I struggle to recommend tracks here because my favorite ones aren't the ones that originally drew me to him. Once I got addicted to his flow I got more adventurous, and now songs I had immediately skipped over on that Portugal trip are my most played. Regardless, I'll give it a shot.</p>
