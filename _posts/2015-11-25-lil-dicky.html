  <p>I crashed at a buddy's place in Chicago, where I was yelled at for not knowing of Lil Dicky.<br>"YOU DON'T KNOW LIL DICKY? BRO. LIL DICKY?!" ..Uh...no, and..uh..who?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Turns out this kid is clever as hell and litters self-depricating humor all over his tracks. A couple tracks are more like comedy bits, a couple bang, a couple are personal -- it's a pretty diverse album despite all being considered "anti-rap" (poking fun at the industry) so I suggest listening to a number of tracks.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The song you should probably know by now is "$ave Dat Money," and if you're interested check out the last track on the YouTube playlist for a funny little documentary on the making of the music video, which was done spending no money and just convincing people/companies to participate.</p>
